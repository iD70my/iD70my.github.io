'''Cydia''' ({{pron-en|ˈsɪdi.ə}}) is a [[application software|software application]] for [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] that is a graphical [[Front and back ends|front end]] to [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] and the [[dpkg]] [[package management system]].  It allows a user to find and download applications and [[Software package (installation)|software package]]s for a [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken]] [[iPhone]], [[iPod Touch]] or [[iPad]], by browsing [[Software repository|repositories]] that list these applications and packages, most of which are available at no cost.<ref>Yukari Iwatani Kane. [http://online.wsj.com/article/SB123629876097346481.html "Breaking Apple's Grip on the iPhone"], ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', March 6, 2009. <!--accessed March 8, 2009--></ref> Cydia also includes the '''Cydia Store''', which offers a number of applications for sale.  

Cydia is developed by Jay Freeman (also known as "saurik").<ref name="SaurikHomepage">{{cite web |url=http://www.saurik.com/ |title=Saurik's Homepage |accessdate=2010-08-04}}</ref> He originally released it as an open-source alternative to [[Installer.app]] on iPhone OS 1.1.x, but Cydia quickly became the most popular package manager after iPhone OS 2.0's release. In September 2010, Freeman's company, Saurik IT, LLC, announced that it had acquired Rock Your Phone, Inc. (makers of Rock.app), which made the Cydia Store the largest third-party app store for jailbroken iOS devices.<ref name="merger">{{cite web|author=saurik|url=http://cydia.saurik.com/faq/merger.html|title=Cydia += Rock Your Phone?|publisher=Cydia}}</ref> As of December 2010, Freeman plans to also release a Cydia Store for [[Mac OS X]] as an alternative to Apple's [[Mac App Store]].<ref name="OSX"/>

The name "Cydia" is an allusion to the [[Codling Moth]] (''Cydia pomonella''), which made famous the "worm in the apple."

== Purpose and function ==
Cydia's primary purpose is to provide a [[graphical user interface]] to [[iOS jailbreaking|jailbroken iOS]] users using [[Advanced Packaging Tool|APT]] repositories to install software unavailable on the App Store.  It also works as a [[Software repository|repository]] aggregator to avoid dependence on a single host and comes with a few trusted "community sources." Many stable packages are available on these repositories; however, additional repositories can be easily added. This enables the iOS development scene to stay as [[Open source|open]] as possible; anyone with a server can set up, host, manage, and update his or her own repository and share it with the community. Most of the community sources will accept package submissions, as this helps packages to gain more exposure than if it was hosted on a separate repository.

Software packages are downloaded directly to an iOS device, to the same location as [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s pre-installed applications (the <code>/Applications</code> [[directory (file systems)|directory]]).  This is normally done through applications on a computer such as [[blackra1n]], but a website named http://www.jailbreakme.com was used for iOS 4.0 and jailbroke the [[iDevice]] through the web browser on the device itself ([[Safari (web browser)|Safari]]).

In addition to offering applications to install, as of September 2009, Cydia was further improved to [[cache]] the [[digital signature|digital signatures]] known as [[SHSH blob|SHSH blobs]] used by Apple to verify restores of the iOS firmware.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://iphonehelp.in/2009/09/15/saurik-new-duplicate-server-bluffs-itunes-you-can-downgrade-to-lower-firmware-version/|title=Saurik New duplicate server bluffs iTunes: You can downgrade to lower firmware version|publisher=iPhonehelp.in|date=2009-09-15}}</ref> This gives users the benefit of being able to [[downgrade]] their firmware to a previous version by means of a [[replay attack]].<ref name="saurik">{{cite web|url=http://www.saurik.com/id/12|publisher=Saurik.com|accessdate=2010-07-28|title=Caching Apple's Signature Server}}</ref>

Using Cydia depends on having a jailbroken device.  Jailbreaking the iPhone was a legal [[Grey area (concept)|grey area]] until July 2010, when the U.S. Copyright Office declared a [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] exemption making jailbreaking the iPhone legal.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wired.com/threatlevel/2010/07/feds-ok-iphone-jailbreaking/|publisher=Wired's Threat Level blog|accessdate=2011-01-18|title=U.S. Declares iPhone Jailbreaking Legal, Over Apple’s Objections}}</ref> Apple policy is that jailbreaking voids the device warranty.

==Cydia Store==
In March 2009, Freeman introduced a simple, unified way for [[Software developer|developers]] to sell applications via Cydia by linking all purchases to a single account, much like the official [[App Store]]. Users may use [[Amazon Payments]] or [[PayPal]] to purchase items from the store.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tuaw.com/2009/03/09/cydia-store-now-open-for-jailbreak-app-sales/ |title=Cydia Store now open for jailbreak app sales |accessdate=2009-08-02 |publisher=Tuaw}}</ref> Developers may add [[digital rights management]] to their paid packages, but most packages do not contain any DRM. The proof of payment is linked to a [[Google]] or [[Facebook]] account in case users move to a new [[iOS (Apple)|iOS]] device or the firmware becomes corrupt or unjailbroken.

While the option exists and is quite popular, developers are not required to use the Cydia Store system to charge for packages.  LockInfo, MewSeek, biteSMS, and WiFi Sync are four examples of such packages; they must be registered separately from the Cydia Store through the developers' own means.
